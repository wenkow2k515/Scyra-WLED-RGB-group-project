# Scyra-WLED-RGB-group-project
##1.Introduction - What is Scrya?

Scrya is an extension of the open-source LED control software WLED. It allows for easy, newbie-friendly creation of custom LED light strip presets with little to no coding knowledge through the use of a simple-to-understand visual system.
WLED is a powerful piece of software, but its confusing UI and difficult learning curve—it requires some background in programming to truly use—have made it difficult for beginners to engage with.
Scrya enables beginners to start creating their own presets immediately through a visual interface, translating their creations into JSON code that works seamlessly through WLED.

##2.Features

- Intuitive and beginner-friendly visual interface
- A login system where people can store their presets
- Simulation of the LED strip in real-time: no more turning your strips off and on in real life.
