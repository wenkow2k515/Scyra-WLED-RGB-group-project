# Scyra-WLED-RGB-Group-Project

## 1. Introduction â€“ What is Scyra? 

**Scyra** is a beginner-friendly extension of the open-source LED control software **WLED**.
- WLED is powerful, but its complex interface and reliance on programming knowledge make it tough for newcomers.
- Scyra solves this by offering a **visual interface**, allowing users to create custom LED presets without coding.
- These presets are converted into JSON and work seamlessly with WLED.

## 2. Features 

- **Intuitive Visual Editor**: Create LED presets with a user-friendly RGB controller
- **Login System**: Save and manage your custom presets
- **Presets Library**: Store locally or in the cloud, with upcoming community sharing
- **Real-time LED Strip Simulation**: Test your designs without hardware
- **Privacy-Focused**: Local storage by default, no mandatory account creation
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices
- **Easy Setup**: Simple connection to your WLED-compatible devices
