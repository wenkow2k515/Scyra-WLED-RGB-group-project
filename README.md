# Scyra-WLED-RGB-group-project
I've set the some basic part on ____init.py____ like goto home page and login part(i still not code it)
The __body.html__ should be the body of the page, so i set a list of button and use __url_for__ to go to other page.
And I also put the name and logo of this project on the body page so we dont need to use it multi

I wonder about the home page, should the home page take the WRGB/LED part directly or with a short description about the web.
About the login part, I think we can use database to take the infor, if the account and password is both correct, we will to the page with those infor
and if it is not correct we will redirect to login page like it show on the lecture.
